# DataRepository

This is a git repository to store human readable data for the SCRC data pipeline. We anticipate that the Data Products stored here will be primarily toml files encoding epidemiological parameters.

## Data Product format

The expected format of the components of data product in the pipeline is described in [this file][format-url] on SCRC Teams.

## Naming suggestions

We suggest that namespaces for Data Products should only contain ASCII letters, ASCII digits, underscores, and dashes (A-Za-z0-9_-), names in the namespace can also include forward slashes (/) to denote structure. Component names in [TOML][toml] should use the same characters allowed in namespaces (A-Za-z0-9_-) â€“ these correspond to the characters allowed in TOML's [*bare keys*][toml-keys]. Component names in hdf5 files, like Data Product names, can also include forward slashes (/) to denote sub-components. At the moment none of these conventions are enforced, but we suggest that everyone maintains them until we find a reason to change them.

### Data Product single-component TOML files

For TOML files, there are currently three types of information that can be stored in one:

1. A simple point estimate of a parameter
```
[latency-period]
type = "point-estimate"
value = 123.12
```

2. The distribution of a parameter 
```
[latency-period]
type = "distribution" 
distribution = "gamma" 
shape = 1
scale = 2 
```
 
 3. Empirical samples drawn from the distribution of a parameter
```
[latency-period] 
type = "samples" 
samples = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
```

In the examples above, each file had a single component called `latency-period` in the data product. If there's only one component in a data product, then we suggest giving it the same name as the last part of the data product's name in the namespace, so for `human/infection/SARS-CoV-2/latency-period`, this would be `latency-period`. This will be the default if no component name is given in a funtion call.

### Data Product multiple-component TOML files

You can have multiple components of any kind in a single data product. For example:

```
[latency-period]
type = "point-estimate"
value = 123.12

[asymptomatic-period] 
type = "point-estimate" 
value = 200.1
```

The only further constraint is that all of the component names (here `latency-period` and `asymptomatic-period`) are different.

## Data Product location and file naming convention

Data Products stored in this repository should be stored in folders according to their namespace, data product name and version number. So the `human/infection/SARS-CoV-2/latency-period` Data Product version `v0.0.1` in the `SCRC` namespace should be found in `SCRC/human/infection/SARS-CoV-2/latency-period` and called [`v0.0.1.toml`](SCRC/human/infection/SARS-CoV-2/latency-period/v0.0.1.toml). Using this convention will make it easy to browse the repository.
